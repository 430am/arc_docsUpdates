# Jumpstart Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Can I contribute to the Arc Jumpstart?

Absolutely! The Jumpstart is a community-driven open-source project and all contributions are welcomed. To get started, review the [Jumpstart Scenario Write-up Guidelines](../scenario_guidelines/) and our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Can use an Azure free trial account with Arc Jumpstart?

Yes, you can use an Azure [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). However, some Jumpstart features may require additional Azure consumption than a free account will provide.

## Does Azure Arc Jumpstart provide Azure or other cloud providers credit?

Arc Jumpstart does not provide free Azure or any other cloud providers credit. To use the Jumpstart you must provide your own environments to run any of the scenarios or solutions.

## What permissions do I need to deploy Arc Jumpstart scenarios and solutions?

Each Arc Jumpstart scenario and solution describes what is needed to run the automation in the prerequisites section. Most of them will ask you to create a service principal therefore you will at least need an Azure **User Access Administrator** or
**Role Base Access Control Administrator** permissions.

## Does the Arc Jumpstart considered "production-ready"?

The intention of the Arc Jumpstart is to focus on the core Azure Arc, edge and IoT capabilities, deployment scenarios, use cases, and ease of use. It does not focus on Azure best practices, and/or other products or open-source projects being leveraged in our code. Jumpstart scenarios, ArcBox, HCIBox, and Agora are all intended for evaluation, training, and demo purposes only and are not supported for production use cases.
